This is a recreation of Wordle, with our own flavour imparted onto it.

Incase you didn't already know, this is [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

So I’ve decided to go with “Garble” because it’s different enough.

## What is Garble?

Garble is Wordle but instead of guessing a secret word, the player must use garble to guess the garble.

It is a flavour of inverse wordle - in this case the word-list is strictly avoided.

## How to play?

- The game starts off with a secret 5-character 'word'.
- The player has 6 attempts to guess this 'word'.
- The guesses must be 5-character 'words'.
- The 'word' MUST NOT be of a known English word - it must be *garble*
- Likewise the secret "word" isn't actually an English word - it's *garble*
