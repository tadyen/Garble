## What is Garble?

Garble is [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) but instead of guessing a secret word, the player must ***use garble to guess the garble***.

## Garble is another wordle clone-alike

So I’ve decided to go with “Garble” because it’s different enough.

## How to play?

- The game starts off with a secret 5-character 'word'.
- The player has 6 attempts to guess this 'word'.
- The guesses must also be 5-character 'words'.
- The 'word' MUST NOT be of a known English word - it must be *garble*
- Likewise the secret 'word' isn't actually an English word - it's *garble*
- For every guess, information is gained about the secret:
  - Characters will be highlighted yellow if the secret contains it too.
  - Characters will be highlighted green if they're also in the right spot.
